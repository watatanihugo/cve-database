# Installation:
1. Install MySQL, the full installation w/ Workbench.
2. Create credentials for the MYSQL server.
3. Run the MYSQL Script to create the database for CVEs.
4. Within the CVE-Database program directory, create a .env file:
```
DB_HOST-localhost
DB_DATABASE=vulnerabilties_db
```
6. Execute the program by running the main.py file.
```bash
python main.py
```
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Import data by using options 7 -> 2. This will automatically populate the database from real JSON files to avoid having to enter large amounts of data.


# Context for CVEs:

**CVE Identifier**: A unique alphanumeric string assigned to each vulnerability entry in the CVE database.

**Attack Vector (AV)**: Describes how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability. It may be represented as "Local" for vulnerabilities exploitable only by local attackers, "Adjacent Network" for those exploitable by attackers on adjacent networks, or "Network" for those exploitable over the network.

**Attack Complexity (AC)**: Indicates the level of complexity required to exploit the vulnerability. It may be "Low" for vulnerabilities that are easy to exploit or "High" for those that are more challenging.

**Privileges Required (PR)**: Specifies the level of privileges an attacker must possess to exploit the vulnerability. It can be "None" for vulnerabilities that can be exploited without any special privileges, "Low" for those requiring minimal privileges, or "High" for those demanding significant privileges.

**User Interaction (UI)**: Reflects whether user interaction is necessary to exploit the vulnerability. It could be "None" if no interaction is needed, "Required" if user interaction is essential, or "Unspecified" if it's uncertain.

**Scope (S)**: Indicates whether the vulnerability impacts the system as a whole ("Unchanged") or just a component ("Changed").

**Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact (CIA)**: Three metrics that assess the impact of the vulnerability on the system's security properties. Each is rated as "None," "Low," "High," or "Unspecified."

For example, the CVE vector notation for a vulnerability might be: CVE-YYYY-NNNN AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. This translates to a vulnerability that can be exploited over the network (AV:N), has low complexity (AC:L), requires low privileges (PR:L), doesn't need user interaction (UI:N), affects only a component (S:U), and has high impact on confidentiality (C:H), integrity (I:H), and availability (A:H).

This notation is crucial to understanding the functionality of this application. Other fields are provided, offering even more context for the user to interpret the CVEs.
